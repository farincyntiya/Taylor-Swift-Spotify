## Taylor Swift's Albums Data Extraction using Spotify API and Spotipy Library

Most people who know me probably know that I've always been a big fan of Taylor Swift. It warmed my heart when some of them say that when they think of Taylor Swift, or when they listen to her songs, they think of me too. How sweet!

Inspired by the "Swiftie" side of me, I built a Tableau dashboard using Taylor Swift's albums data. At first, I found a neat and clean dataset about Taylor Swift's entire discography on Kaggle, which made me end up being curious about how the publisher obtained the data. Besides, I only intended to use the albums data owned by Taylor Swift, not the albums she has lost the rights to, back in 2019.

Thanks to my curiosity and some sources I found on the internet, I succeed in extracting Taylor Swift's albums data on Spotify, such as the Audio Features and Popularity data, from the Spotify API by using Python and the Spotipy library. Some data cleaning process in Google Colab was also applied before I got to work on Tableau, including removing duplicated data and keeping only data from albums owned by Taylor Swift, namely Lover, folklore, evermore, Fearless (Taylor's Version), and Red (Taylor's Version).

The process of creating this dashboard was challenging and initially, some things were complicated, but that's how I got to learn a lot and had fun exploring the features of Tableau!
